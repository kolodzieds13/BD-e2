## Abstract
Improved forest management (IFM) that enhances carbon storage with silvicultural practices is crucial for climate change mitigation but currently lacks transparent, cost-effective monitoring methods. Thus, we developed the Emerald Edge Biomass Density Model (BD-e2) comprising open-source tools, remote sensing data, and machine learning models that predict aboveground biomass density (AGBD) at 30m resolution and map historical AGBD (1985-2023). We tested this data-driven approach across 863,662 ha of forest in western Washington, USA, leveraging 17,287 Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) ABGD observations (2019-2023) and predictor variables derived from Landsat observations (39-year series) and environmental data across the study area (RÂ² = 0.72, MAE = 76.97 Mg/ha).

Our pixel-based summaries of ownership parcels illustrate how analyzing remote-sensing-based model results can identify specific AGBD thresholds associated with different management. Regeneration harvests reduced biomass by an average of 59.72% and occurred on Private parcels averaging AGBD of >160 Mg/ha. In contrast, thinning caused minimal reductions (2.8%), with parcels averaging 140 Mg/ha AGBD. Private forestlands exhibited AGBD declines of 0.81 Mg/ha/year. Conversely, State and Federal forestlands exhibited consistent 1.08 and 0.97 Mg/ha/year AGBD increases, respectively. We identified 70,440 ha of harvestable forestlands for potential IFM implementation, possibly avoiding 5,844,331 Mg of biomass losses, including 2,775,978 Mg from Industrial forests. With long-term trends and established baselines by ownership type, we can inform decision-making and explore innovative financing mechanisms to incentivize carbon-friendly forest management.
